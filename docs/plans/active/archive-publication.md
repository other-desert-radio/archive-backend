# Archive publication

## Current checkpoint

Configuration was reviewed; the user requested the next chunk. The export-only
launcher is now `publish-locally`, and destinations derive from the configured
checkout with the legacy sibling fallback. Awaiting review before snapshot
reading. Other stubs remain provisional and disconnected from live
routes/startup. Continue with one responsibility per review.

## Agreed scope

Admin-only durable archive publication with revision tracking, consistent
snapshot export, conservative Git synchronization/recovery, authenticated live
progress, and a reconnectable confirmation modal. Local publication targets
`publish-dev`; server publication targets `main`. Success means pushed to
GitHub. Standalone `publish-locally` exports without committing or acknowledging
revisions. Preserve unrelated Git work and assets. The user subsequently
requested a brief publication-state entry in `human_docs/databases_human.md`;
that specific update is included alongside the authoritative database reference.

## Review gates

- [x] Agree file structure, then create only approved placeholders.
- [x] Explicitly request scaffolding; establish contracts and unfinished stubs
      off live routes/startup and verify structure.
- [x] User review of existing scaffolding.
- [x] Revision state migration and transactional triggers, with rollback tests.
- [x] User review of revision state and triggers.
- [x] Checkout configuration and path validation.
- [x] User review of checkout configuration and path validation.
- [x] Export-only launcher rename and configured destinations.
- [ ] User review of export-only launcher and destinations.
- [ ] Consistent-snapshot archive reading.
- [ ] Durable job schema and persistence.
- [ ] Sanitized bounded logs and completed-job retention.
- [ ] Advisory-lock ownership and concurrent-start rejection.
- [ ] Abandoned-job interruption handling.
- [ ] Git checkout/repository/branch safety validation.
- [ ] Git fetch and fast-forward synchronization.
- [ ] Generated-path staging, commit, and non-force push.
- [ ] Interrupted commit/push reconciliation.
- [ ] Runner orchestration and captured-revision acknowledgement.
- [ ] Admin-only status and job-detail reads.
- [ ] Admin-only publication/retry start endpoint.
- [ ] PostgreSQL notification listener and reconnect behavior.
- [ ] Authenticated SSE and durable-state resynchronization.
- [ ] Browser publication client and reconnectable state.
- [ ] Responsive admin-only header control.
- [ ] Confirmation modal and explicit publication submission.
- [ ] Accessible progress/log view and modal reopen behavior.
- [ ] Failure/retry and refresh reconnection behavior.
- [ ] Safe checkout/identity/branch setup script.
- [ ] Docker Git/SSH installation and runtime checkout/credential mounts.
- [ ] Operational documentation review.
- [ ] Integrated acceptance, including desktop, 390px, and 320px.

Each implementation unit requires approval before starting the next. Use the
structure/scaffolding checkpoints within that unit when new files or contracts
are needed; do not repeat a feature-wide scaffolding pass. Include focused tests
and authoritative documentation updates with the behavior they describe. Split
any listed unit further if it becomes difficult to review. Use disposable
databases and temporary Git remotes for tests. Browser acceptance must cover
desktop, 390px, and 320px. Real GitHub push requires separate review.

## Next action

Review the launcher rename, package command, destination resolver, and export
documentation. The launcher changes to the backend root before invoking the
existing exporter. A shared checkout-path resolver preserves path validation
without requiring unrelated publisher settings. Standalone exports default to
`../archive-site` only when `ARCHIVE_CHECKOUT_PATH` is unset.

Thirteen focused configuration/export tests passed with 88 assertions, including
the renamed package command against disposable PostgreSQL and temporary output.
It preserves unrelated assets, exports JSON/images, and leaves revisions
unchanged without Git. No regular database or real checkout was modified.

After approval, implement consistent-snapshot archive reading only. Follow
[development modes](../../DEVELOPMENT.md#development-modes).
